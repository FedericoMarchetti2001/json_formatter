# JSON Formatter Next.js Application

This document outlines the structure and key files of the JSON Formatter Next.js application.

## Application Structure

The application follows the standard Next.js App Router structure.

```
json_formatter_nextjs/
├── src/
│   └── app/
│       ├── page.tsx         # The root page of the application.
│       └── layout.tsx       # The root layout for the application.
├── public/                  # Static assets (images, fonts, etc.)
├── next.config.ts           # Next.js configuration
├── package.json             # Project dependencies and scripts
├── tsconfig.json            # TypeScript configuration
├── eslint.config.mjs        # ESLint configuration
└── postcss.config.mjs       # PostCSS configuration
```

## Key Files and Folders

- **`src/app/`**: This directory contains the main application code using the Next.js App Router. Pages and layouts are defined within this directory.
- **`src/app/page.tsx`**: This file defines the root page of the application (`/`). It's the entry point for the main content displayed at the application's base URL.
- **`src/app/layout.tsx`**: This file defines the root layout that wraps all pages in the application. It's used for setting up the basic HTML structure, including `<html>` and `<body>` tags, and can include elements like headers, footers, or navigation that persist across pages.
- **`public/`**: This folder is used for static assets that need to be served directly by the web server. Files placed here are accessible from the root of the application (e.g., `/images/fog.jpeg` would map to `json_formatter_nextjs/public/images/fog.jpeg`).
- **`next.config.ts`**: This file allows you to configure various aspects of your Next.js application, such as environment variables, headers, redirects, and more.
- **`package.json`**: This file lists all the project's dependencies and defines scripts for common tasks like starting the development server (`npm run dev`), building the application (`npm run build`), and running linters or tests.
- **`tsconfig.json`**: This file is the configuration file for the TypeScript compiler. It specifies compiler options and the files that should be included in the compilation.
- **`eslint.config.mjs`**: This file configures ESLint, a tool used to identify and report on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code, with the goal of making code more consistent and avoiding bugs.
- **`postcss.config.mjs`**: This file configures PostCSS, a tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript plugins. It's often used for tasks like autoprefixing CSS rules for better browser compatibility.
